      <h2>üîç Reverse Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Reverse engineering is the art and science of taking apart software or
        hardware to understand its construction and functionality. It‚Äôs a core
        skill in cybersecurity, often used to analyze malware, understand
        proprietary protocols, or audit compiled software for vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common tools include disassemblers (IDA Pro, Ghidra), debuggers (GDB,
        x64dbg), and decompilers. It‚Äôs a mix of creativity, patience, and
        technical expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, reverse engineering can help identify security flaws,
        recover lost documentation, or ensure interoperability between systems.

      <p>
        Google Cloud Platform is a collection of cloud computing services built
        on the same infrastructure that powers Google‚Äôs own products, like
        Search, Gmail, and YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
        GCP offers a wide range of services, from virtual machines with Compute
        Engine to serverless functions, AI/ML APIs, Kubernetes (GKE), and
        high-performance storage solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organizations use GCP to scale globally, pay only for the resources they
        use, and integrate advanced analytics or AI into their workflows with
        minimal setup.
